### Introduction

Welcome to the FHIR Implementation Guide for Nepalâ€™s Health Information System. This guide outlines the key concepts, features, and use cases for implementing FHIR-based data exchange across health systems in Nepal.

### Key Concepts

- **Resources**: FHIR structures health data as modular "resources" such as `Patient`, `Observation`, `MedicationRequest`, etc.
- **Interoperability**: Designed to ensure smooth data exchange between disparate healthcare systems.
- **RESTful API**: FHIR supports RESTful APIs for consistent, accessible, and standardized data interactions.
- **Data Formats**: FHIR supports multiple formats including JSON, XML, and RDF.
- **Terminology Services**: Includes support for standardized terminologies using `CodeSystem`, `ValueSet`, and `ConceptMap`.

### Use Cases

- Integration of patient data across hospitals and clinics  
- Digital health registries for maternal and child health  
- National disease surveillance and reporting systems  
*_(Additional use cases can be listed as relevant)_*

### Key Features

- **FHIR Server**: Centralized infrastructure to host and serve health data using FHIR standards.
- **Implementation Guide (IG)**: Provides customized FHIR profiles, resource mappings, and validation rules.
- **Terminology Services**: Enables standardized coding and mapping across systems.
- **Core Resources**: Includes support for `Patient`, `Encounter`, `Observation`, `Organization`, and more.
- **API Documentation**: Technical references and guidelines for implementers and developers.

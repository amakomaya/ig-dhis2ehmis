This section outlines the key use cases for exchanging health information within the Nepal Electronic Health Management Information System (EHMIS). Each health journey represents a core service delivery area aligned with national reporting and programmatic needs.

#### [MNCH Health Journey](health-journey-mnch.html)
Captures maternal, newborn, and child health data across the continuum of care — from pregnancy registration, antenatal visits, and delivery, to postnatal follow-up and child health services. Includes tracking of key indicators for national reporting.

#### [Outpatient (OPD) Health Journey](health-journey-opd.html)
Describes the flow of outpatient consultations, including patient registration, diagnosis, treatment, referral, and follow-up — all modeled using FHIR resources to ensure standardized recording and reporting.

#### [Immunization Health Journey](health-journey-immunization.html)
Illustrates how vaccine administration is documented using FHIR, capturing antigen details, dates, batch numbers, adverse events, and linkage to patient records — supporting EPI program reporting.

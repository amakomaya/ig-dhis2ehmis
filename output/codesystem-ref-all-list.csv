These durations are represented in the form P[n]Y[n]M[n]DT[n]H[n]M[n]S or P[n]W. The [n] is replaced by the value for each of the time elements that follow the [n] and the letters have the meaning:  P is the duration designator (for period) placed at the start of the duration representation. Y is the year designator that follows the value for the number of years. M is the month designator that follows the value for the number of months. W is the week designator that follows the value for the number of weeks. D is the day designator that follows the value for the number of days. T is the time designator that precedes the time components of the representation. H is the hour designator that follows the value for the number of hours. M is the minute designator that follows the value for the number of minutes. S is the second designator that follows the value for the number of seconds.","ValueSet/age-range"
